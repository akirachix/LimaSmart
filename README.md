Lima Smart is a smart farming project that intends to improve the quality and quantity of yields for Kenyan small-holder farmers while using smart irrigation.

The project aims to help Farmers by providing information about their agriculture fields. Monitoring environmental factors is the major factor to improve the yield of the crops. The feature of this project includes monitoring temperature, humidity and moisture in agricultural field through sensors DHT11, soil moisture using  a a Soil Moisture Sensor (LM393) and  the water level using a Water Level Sensor (FSW-6 Float Switch)

We are providing farmers with prompts in form of SMS about what happens in the farm using a sim module .
